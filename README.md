[![Dev Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/AnandChowdhary/calendar-link/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/AnandChowdhary/calendar-link?type=dev)

JavaScript library to generate an event link for Google Calendar, Yahoo! Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, etc.

### Usage

You can import the library and use it:

```javascript
import calendarLink from 'calendar-link'
```

## Development

### Excluding peerDependencies

On library development, one might want to set some peer dependencies, and thus remove those from the final bundle. You can see in [Rollup docs](https://rollupjs.org/#peer-dependencies) how to do that.

Good news: the setup is here for you, you must only include the dependency name in `external` property within `rollup.config.js`. For example, if you want to exclude `lodash`, just write there `external: ['lodash']`.

### Automatic releases

_**Prerequisites**: you need to create/login accounts and add your project to:_
 - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
 - [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
 - [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io)

_**Prerequisite for Windows**: Semantic-release uses
**[node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)** so you will need to
install
[Microsoft's windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools)
using this command:_

```bash
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

#### Setup steps

Follow the console instructions to install semantic release and run it (answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?").

_Note: make sure you've setup `repository.url` in your `package.json` file_

```bash
npm install -g semantic-release-cli
semantic-release-cli setup
# IMPORTANT!! Answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?" question. It is already prepared for you :P
```

From now on, you'll need to use `npm run commit`, which is a convenient way to create conventional commits.

Automatic releases are possible thanks to [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), which publishes your code automatically on [github](https://github.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), plus generates automatically a changelog. This setup is highly influenced by [Kent C. Dodds course on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library)

### Git Hooks

There is already set a `precommit` hook for formatting your code with Prettier :nail_care:

By default, there are two disabled git hooks. They're set up when you run the `npm run semantic-release-prepare` script. They make sure:
 - You follow a [conventional commit message](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog)
 - Your build is not going to fail in [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) (or your CI server), since it's runned locally before `git push`

This makes more sense in combination with [automatic releases](#automatic-releases)

### FAQ

#### `Array.prototype.from`, `Promise`, `Map`... is undefined?

TypeScript or Babel only provides down-emits on syntactical features (`class`, `let`, `async/await`...), but not on functional features (`Array.prototype.find`, `Set`, `Promise`...), . For that, you need Polyfills, such as [`core-js`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [`babel-polyfill`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) (which extends `core-js`).

For a library, `core-js` plays very nicely, since you can import just the polyfills you need:

```javascript
import "core-js/fn/array/find"
import "core-js/fn/string/includes"
import "core-js/fn/promise"
...
```

#### What if I don't want git-hooks, automatic releases or semantic-release?

Then you may want to:
 - Remove `commitmsg`, `postinstall` scripts from `package.json`. That will not use those git hooks to make sure you make a conventional commit
 - Remove `npm run semantic-release` from `.travis.yml`

#### What if I don't want to use coveralls or report my coverage?

Remove `npm run report-coverage` from `.travis.yml`
